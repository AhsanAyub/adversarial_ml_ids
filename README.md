# Adversarial Examples on the IDS Dataset

The repo is created to maintain the code base of the Adversarial Machine Learning applications, such as, Model Evasion Attack, on the publically accessible dataset of network-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS).

The work has been published at the [22nd IEEE International Conference on Computational Science and Engineering (IEEE CSE 2019)](https://ee-ciss.princeton.edu).
