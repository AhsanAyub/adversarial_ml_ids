# Adversarial Examples on the IDS Dataset

The repo is created to maintain the code base of the Adversarial Machine Learning applications, such as, Model Evasion Attack, on the publically accessible dataset of network-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS).

The work has been published at the [IEEE 2020 54th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)](https://ee-ciss.princeton.edu).
